# Maximal sum

## Description
Write a program that reads a rectangular matrix of size `N x M` and finds in it the square `3 x 3` that has maximal sum of its elements.
Print that sum.

## Input
- On the first line you will receive the numbers **N** and **M** seperated by a single space
- On the next **N** lines there will be **M** numbers seperated with spaces - the elements of the matrix

## Output
- Print the maximal sum of `3 x 3` square

## Constraints
- 3 <= **N**, **M** <= 1024
- Numbers in the matrix will be in the interval `[ -1000, 1000 ]`
- Time limit: **0.1s**
- Memory limit: **8MB**
